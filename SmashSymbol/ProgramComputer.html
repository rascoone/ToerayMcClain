        <li>Open Adobe Illustrator.</li>
        <li>Click on create new then click on the "Art and Illustration" tab at the top of the opened window</li>
        <li>Click on the option at the top left titled "postcard" then click on "create"</li>
        <li>Select the circle tool to draw a empty (in terms of color) circle in middle of the postcard 1/3 of the way down from the top. Draw the circle so that there is about one inch of space from either side of the circle (left and right).</li>
        <li>Select the gradient tool and shade the inside of the circle so that the lighter color is on the left side(white) and the darker color is towards the right(black).</li>
        <li>Select the rectangle tool to draw a  1/2cm in width rectangle (this rectangle is going to go over the circle). This rectangle should start at 1/3 of the way from the left of the circle and top and bottom should end at 1cm above and below the circle for length. </li>
        <li>The final rectangle should be about 1 cm in height but go horizontal this time. Starting at about 1/3 of the way from the bottom and going across the circle as well, the ends should also be about 1cm out of the circle from left and right like the first rectangle.</li>
        <li>Above the circle should be fire/flames. Selecting the draw tool, from the left side of the circle (connecting) draw a squiggly line that goes up and down traveling to the right side of the circle. the squiggly lines should start onnce the intial line if 1 in above the circle and stop 1 in above the circle of right side. Make sure the left end of the squiggly line connects with the left side of the circle, and the right side of the squiggly line connects with the right side of the circle.</li>
        <li>A little to the left of the the first fire/flame you drew, and starting on the circle, draw a squiggly triangle-like shape that connects from the circle to the flame (no bottom side of the triangle).</li>
        <li>Draw 3 tildes (symbol underneith escape key on keyboard that looks like "~") turned 90 degrees so that it's vertical instead of horizontal. One should be 1cm from the top left side of the first flame. The second one should be 1cm up from the middle of the first flame and should be an actual shape instead of a line (about 1in in height and 1/2in in width, and an open center). The third should be 1cm from the top right side of the first flame.</li>
