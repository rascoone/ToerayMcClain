                        <p>The Smash bros series has become my most favorite game series ever. I have so many memories since the ending of Melee to the beginning of Ultimate. I've made many friends and have spent (way too) many hours playing this game.</p>

                        <p>I remember a lot of the female characters in this game were super annoying for me in particular to fight against. They had such a loose and fast playstyle and it gave me trouble online. I named one of the parakeets I use to own Sophitia which was based off a character in this game.</p>

                        <p>Like playing dress up with dolls, character customization is so much fun for gamers. I would sink hours into the creation screen trying to make the most weirdly accurate representation of outside entities or just to design an original character. Sometimes I would draw my creations as art practice.</p>

                    For many, our memories are the biggest and most important collection we possess. My memories revolving around video games are the most precious things to me. Every game that made my heart smile and satisfied my  competitive hunger has molded me into who I am today. <br> <br>
                    This particular collection, as you can see, is comprised mostly of competitive and multiplayer games. That is why the gaming community feels so home to me. Almost every game I played growing up was designed to be shared with someone else. Being a man of action over speech, I've always let my skills with a controller do the talking for me. With that skill I've talked myself into many friendships and into where I am today: college. <br> <br>
                    Now, I am seeking a degree in Computer Game Design at George Mason University. Sometimes I feel like I'll never stop being a gamer. The day I put down the controller is the day I've finished my collection. However, That day will only come if I have lost my memory and thus, who I am. Just know I will gladly collect those memories again if needed.
