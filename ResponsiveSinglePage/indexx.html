                <p>Go down the fourth pipe (saves about 3 secs), Land on front edge of pipe and start holding down, want to exit secret room with time at 380. Make sure you master the first jump, start holding right about halfway down to get to full speed. Land on the first block and run and then jump from before reaching edge of coin blocks so that you land on the ground just before the pipe. Full jump from middle of pipe, then one short hop, to full hop to top of flag pole. You want to make sure you hit the top because it’ll skip the animation of Mario walking off the base block of the flagpole, thus, losing you time.</p>

At the part where there is one koopa and 2 goombas, at the very edge of the right overhead block you want tap the jump button to do the smallest jump possible over the koopa. When you reach the three goombas jump over them and land on the very left edge of the first piranha plant pipe then land on the right side of the second piranha plant pipe. On the upward moving platforms jump up over the roof of coinblocks and run right until you see the three pipes. Go down the pipe labeled 4.</p>

                <p>Really simple level. No real tricks to beat it. Just practice what’s coming up and when and where to jump. You have plenty of time to do full jumps over the piranha plant pipes (try jumping a little 	earlier rather than later). Then run straight in front of the stairs before the flagpole and do a full jump. Then do one small jump then full jump to reach top of flagpole.</p>

                <p>Normally, you would climb the vine, but for the speed run you want to do the wrong warp. So, you want to find your preferred way of getting in between the coinblocks and the bottom blocks where the coins are. To do the wrong warp you need to jump backwards into three walls: the first being the very edge of the roof of the farthest coinblock as you’re going up to meet the three goombas, the second one is right after jumping over the goomba you want hit the last roof coinblock before hopping down below the 3 sets of question blocks, the third is when you reach right before the end of the last question mark below before the descending platforms. Then you want to skip the vine you would normally climb and go down the third pipe (however, you want to make sure you hit that block because if you don’t a piranha plat will kill you). You want to enter pipe on the left half of the screen (at time 375). If you scroll the screen to far the right it will take you to the coin cash. Then you want to make your way down the pipe that says 8.</p>

                <p>This one has a lot of obstacles and hard jumps. There’s no real solution to this, you have to just grind out a consistent path that you can follow that won’t slow you down.  However, after the four green koopas, you’re going to have to do a really hard jump where the only way to jump over the 3 goombas is to do so a few pixels right before the first goomba. If you do the pipe jump over the piranha plant pipe before 3 goombas you can get the spacing to land on the first and third koopa of the 3 koopas that spawn in a row, which will spawn only 2 goombas to jump over making it easier. Then you want to hit the star block (third block from the left) in one of the coin blocks right after the two winged green koopas which will manipulate the flag pole so that you don’t lose time.</p>

                <p>For the first stairs, jump and land on the right edge of the second step, then do a full jump off of it, followed by a short jump. You want to skip the spring and going using the top coinblocks. Then you want to stay on top of the bulletbill cannons and coinblocks after. For the piranha plant pipe right after the winged green koopa between two piranha plant pipes, you’re going to want to slow down just a bit after landing of the far right side of the edge of the ground block without slowing down to walking speed before jumping. Once you’re above the piranha plant you can start holding right again. For the winged green koopas, just hold left very slightly so that you run into the first one, then jump over the rest. Then land on the bullet bull launcher, run off of it then jump as soon as you land (it is possible to jump off the winged green koopa if that koopa gives you that pattern).</p>

                <p>Dealing with the hammer bros is tricky. For the first set, you want to take the bottom route (if he gets in your way just kill him). For the second set you want to take the top most route (if a hammerbro spawns on top you want to take the middle path instead).  Four the last four you just want to full jump over them, if you see them jump just let go of the jump button and should kill them instead (as long as Mario starts falling before you touch them you’ll kill them). You want to avoid having the time having a three on the in the ones place (i.e. 243) to avoid getting the three corresponding fireworks. So, do a full jump from the stacked blocks onto the third block right after that, followed by jumping on the edge of that block so that you run into the next set of two. This should slow you down enough that you get 242.</p>

                <p>Jump over the large lava pit with the sideways moving platform (will take a bit of practice). Then jump straight at the first piranha and hold down to go into the pipe (the piranha will disappear before you reach it).  Upon spawning out of the pipe press left for jump a quick moment. Down land on the beetles because that will spawn a piranha plant in the pipe you need to go in. Once you make your way to the pipe suspended in midair, you want to jump (right about a little off the edge of the first block after the pipe and lava pit after running off of that pipe) into the pipe’s halfway mark to do a pixel perfect 1 frame jump to reach it. Do a small jump forward off of the pipe Mario spawns from, then you want to jump over the second pipe, then go back into it to do a wrong warp into the water section (you need to scroll the screen far enough to the right for this to work). Different runners will do different ways to get through the water section, I would suggest finding which method works for you (note that if you hold a after a swim Mario will sink faster). Hold nothing going into the pipe so Mario walks faster. After spawning, run off and do a full jump to kill the hammerbro. Then you have judge whether or not to jump or run under Bowser. GG!</p>
